📖 Overview

Welcome to the open-source repository for our paper "Cross-regional validation of the PhenoFlex framework from flowering date prediction in apple: a study across Germany and Spain". 🌍  We assessed the performance of the PhenoFlex framework when used to estimate a common set of parameters across multiple apple cultivars from two climatic settings (Germany 🇩🇪 and Spain 🇪🇸). By employing both ocation- and species-specific calibrations, alongside two optimization procedures, our findings offer insights into species-level phenology modeling.

🗂 Dataset

The dataset including phenological and meteorological data for:

    5 German cultivars 🇩🇪
    11 Spanish cultivars 🇪🇸

will be made available upon request.
