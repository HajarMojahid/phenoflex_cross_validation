📖 Overview

Welcome to the open-source repository for our paper "Cross-regional validation of the PhenoFlex framework from flowering date prediction in apple: a study across Germany and Spain". 🌍  The performance of PhenoFlex when used to estimate a common set of parameters across multiple apple cultivars from two climatic settings (Germany 🇩🇪 and Spain 🇪🇸). By employing both location- and species-specific calibrations and two optimization procedures. Such results may provide a general outlook at the species level.

🗂 Dataset

The dataset including phenological and meteorological data for:

    5 German cultivars 🇩🇪
    11 Spanish cultivars 🇪🇸

will made available upon request.
